# BitcoinPrice_Prediction_Using_RNN_And_Arima_And_AR
A python project to find the bitcoin price using the RNN and ARIMA,AR  algorithm.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It uses peer-to-peer technology and operates with no central authority or banks. The management of transactions and issuance of bitcoins is carried out by network. Bitcoin is open-source, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin. Some of the advantages of Bitcoin are:
•	Fast peer-to-peer transactions
•	Worldwide payments
•	Low processing fees
•	Private Transactions

Bitcoin uses a technology called “Blockchain” in the backend. All the transactions are hashed prior to the processing. The encryption thus makes the transaction secure from hacks. Bitcoin transactions are then processed through a process called as “Mining”. Mining involves huge servers and involving decrypting the transactions as blocks. Therefore, if a server farm decrypts a block of BTC transactions, that particular server gets a bitcoin “Prize” of a certain number of bitcoins depending on the complexity of the block. 
The purpose of this report is to present the detailed tasks involved in the prediction of bitcoin price based on the historical data and also entailed analysis of some of the algorithms. For this project, we have gathered data from Kaggle. We are using time series analysis on the data to predict the future price and visualize the results using “matplotlib”. This report will give an in-depth detail of the various steps involved in this project. From our analysis, we found that RNN predictions are reliable.
